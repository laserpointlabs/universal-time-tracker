# Analytics Guide

Understanding the analytics and insights provided by Universal Time Tracker.

## Overview

The Universal Time Tracker provides comprehensive analytics to help you understand your work patterns, optimize productivity, and make data-driven decisions about your time management.

## üî• Activity Heatmap

The **GitHub-style Activity Heatmap** provides a visual overview of your coding activity throughout the year.

### How It Works

- **Grid Layout**: 53 weeks √ó 7 days showing the entire year
- **Color Intensity**: Darker colors indicate more hours worked
- **Hover Details**: Shows exact date, hours worked, and activity level

### Intensity Levels

| Level | Hours | Color | Description |
|-------|-------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | 0 hours | Light gray | No activity |
| 1 | 0-2 hours | Light green | Light activity |
| 2 | 2-4 hours | Medium green | Moderate activity |
| 3 | 4-6 hours | Dark green | High activity |
| 4 | 6+ hours | Darkest green | Very high activity |

### Key Metrics

- **Total Hours**: Sum of all tracked time for the year
- **Active Days**: Number of days with any tracked time
- **Average Hours/Day**: Average hours on active days only
- **Best Day**: Maximum hours worked in a single day

### Use Cases

**Pattern Recognition:**
